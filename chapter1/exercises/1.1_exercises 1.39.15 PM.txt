1.1-1: Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real world example that requires computer a complex-hull.

Sorting: retrieving a list of users in alphabetical order.

Complex Hull: base shape for container with modular parts.

1.1-2: Other than speed, what other measures of effecienct might one use in a real-world setting?

Resource usage, magnitude

1.1-3: Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Linked-list: Doesnâ€™t use a lot of memory, simple to understand, tricky to implement

1.1-4: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems similar? How are they different?

They both are in pursuit of a most efficient route, but the shortest path is concerned with a single traversing element while the traveling-salesman is concerned with multiple.

1.1-5: Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one where an approximate solution is good enough

An algorithm for determining space-flight trajectory is needed to be the best, while an algorithm for most effecient food container is less important
