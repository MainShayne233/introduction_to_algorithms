This is a repository where I answer questions, implement concepts, and just generally work my way through Introduction to Algorithms (3rd) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

Code will be implemented in many different languages, but primarily in Ruby and Elixir
